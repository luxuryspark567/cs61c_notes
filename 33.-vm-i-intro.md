# 33. VM I Intro

## What does the core of the OS do?

* ﻿﻿OS is the (first) thing that runs when computer starts.
  * ﻿﻿Starts services (100+).
    * ﻿﻿File system, Network stack (Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, ...), TTY (keyboard), etc.
* ﻿﻿Provides interaction with the outside world:
  * ﻿﻿Finds and controls all devices in the machine in a general way:
    * ﻿﻿Relies on hardware specific "device drivers"
* ﻿﻿Loads, runs and manages programs:
  * ﻿﻿Isolation: Each program runs (i.e., appears to run) in its own little world.
  * ﻿﻿Resource-sharing: Multiple programs share the same resources:
    * ﻿﻿Memory
    * ﻿﻿1/O devices: disk, keyboard, display, network, etc.
* ﻿﻿Time-sharing: Processor (CPU) runs multiple processes.

## Multiprogramming at a High Level

* ﻿﻿The OS manages multiprogramming, which is running multiple applications (processes) "simultaneously" on one CPU.&#x20;
  * (vs. multiprocessing: running processes simultaneously on different CPUs. The OS also manages this.)
* ﻿﻿This is achieved via OS context switches, i.e., switches between processes very quickly (on the human time scale):
  * ﻿﻿Save current process state (program counter, registers, etc.)
  * ﻿﻿Load next process state to execute next instruction on CPU
  * ﻿﻿Do not switch out data between main memory and disk! Too costly...

## Main Memory and Secondary Memory

## Main Memory is DRAM

* ﻿﻿Dynamic Random Access Memory:
  * ﻿﻿Latency to access first word: \~10ns (\~30-40 processor cycles), each successive (0.5ns - Ins)
  * ﻿﻿Each access brings 64 bits, supports 'bursts'
  * ﻿﻿$3/GiB
* ﻿﻿Data is impermanent:
  * ﻿﻿Dynamic: capacitors store bits, so needs periodic refresh to maintain charge
  * ﻿﻿Volatile: when power is removed, loses data.
* ﻿﻿Contrast with SRAM (for caches):
  * ﻿﻿Static (no capacitors) but still volatile
  * ﻿﻿Faster (0.5 ns)/more expensive/lower density

## Storage / "Disk" / Secondary Memory

* ﻿﻿Attached as a peripheral 1/0 device. Non-volatile
* ﻿﻿Solid-State Drive (SSD)
  * Access: 40-100us (\~100k proc. cycles)
  * $0.05-0.5/GB
  * Usually flash memory
* Hard Disk Drive (HDD),
  * Access: <5-10ms (10-20M proc. cycles)
  * $0.01-0.1/GB
  * Mechanical

## How SSD works

* ﻿﻿Made with transistors (nothing mechanical/rotating)
* ﻿﻿Operates like a "Ginormous" register file.
  * ﻿﻿Furthermore, does not "forget" when power is off (non-volatile)
* ﻿﻿Fast access to all locations, regardless of address
  * Still much slower than register, DRAM.
  * Read/write blocks, not bytes.
  * Potential reliability issues...
* Some unusual requirements:
  * Can't erase single bits - only entire blocks

## Virtual Memory

* ﻿﻿Virtual memory is the next level in the memory hierarchy:
  * ﻿﻿Give each process the illusion of a full memory address space that it has completely for itself.
  * ﻿﻿Under the hood: working set of pages reside in main memory; other pages are in disk.
* ﻿﻿Benefits:
  * ﻿﻿Demand paging provides the ability to run programs larger than the primary memory (DRAM).
  * ﻿﻿OS can share memory and protect programs from each other.
  * ﻿﻿Hides differences between machine configurations.
* ﻿﻿Today, more important for protection than space management.
  * ﻿﻿(Historically, virtual memory predates caches.)

## Virtual vs. Physical Addresses

* ﻿﻿Address Space: set of addresses for all available memory locations.
  * ﻿﻿Now, two kinds of memory addresses!
* ﻿﻿Virtual Address Space
  * ﻿﻿Set of addresses that the user program knows about
* ﻿﻿Physical Address Space
  * ﻿﻿Set of addresses that map to actual physical locations in memory
  * ﻿﻿Hidden from user applications
* For each program, a memory manager maps (translates) between these two address spaces.

Processes use virtual addresses. Many processes, all using same (conflicting) addresses

## OS Virtual Memory Management Responsibilities

1. ﻿﻿﻿Map virtual addresses to physical addresses.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Use both memory and disk.
   1. ﻿﻿Give illusion of larger memory by storing some content on disk.
   2. ﻿﻿Disk is usually much larger and slower than DRAM.
3. Protection:
   1. Isolate memory between processes.

## Paged Memory

* ﻿﻿The concept of "paged memory" dominates:
  * Physical memory (DRAM) is broken into pages.
  * ﻿﻿A disk access loads an entire page into memory.
  * ﻿﻿Typical page size: 4 KiB+ (on modern OSs)
    * ﻿﻿Need 12 bits of page offsetto address all 4 KiB bytes.
* ﻿﻿If virtual and physical pages are the same size, then memory translation maps Virtual Page Number (VPN) to a Physical Page Number (PPN).

## Translation: How a Program Accesses Memory

1. ﻿﻿﻿Program executes a load specifying a virtual address (VA).
2. ﻿﻿﻿Computer translates VA to the physical address (PA) in memory.
   1. ﻿﻿Extract virtual page number (VPN) from VA, e.g., top 20 bits
   2. ﻿﻿Look up physical page number (PPN) in page table
   3. Construct PA: physical page number + offset (from virtual address)
3. ﻿﻿﻿If the physical page is not in memory, then OS loads it in from disk.
4. ﻿﻿﻿The OS reads memory at the PA and returns the data to the program.

## What Do Page Tables Look Like?

* ﻿﻿E.g., 32-bit virtual address space, 4-KiB pages
  * ﻿﻿2^32 virtual addresses / (2^12 B/page) = 2^20 virtual page numbers
* ﻿﻿One Page Table per process:
* One entry per virtual page number.
* Entry has physical page number (or disk address) as well as status bits.

{% hint style="info" %}
﻿﻿Note: A Page Table is NOT a cache!!

* A Page Table does not have data! It is a lookup table.
* ﻿﻿All VPNs have a valid entry.
  * But if it helps you, "no tags; index is VPN"

## OS Virtual Memory Management Responsibilities

1. ﻿﻿﻿Map virtual addresses to physical addresses.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Use both memory and disk.
   1. ﻿﻿Give illusion of larger memory by storing some content on disk.
   2. Disk is usually much larger and slower than DRAM.
3. Protection:
   1. ﻿﻿Isolate memory between processes.
   2. Each process gets dedicated "private" memory.
   3. Errors in one program won't corrupt memory of other programs.
   4. Prevent user programs from messing with OS's memory.

What if process tries to modify instructions or system data?

## Protection with Page Tables

* Each process has a dedicated page table.
  * OS keeps track of which process is active.
* ﻿﻿Isolation: Assign processes different pages in DRAM
  * ﻿﻿Prevents accessing other processors' memory
  * ﻿﻿Page tables managed by OS
* ﻿﻿Sharing is also possible:
  * ﻿﻿OS may assign same physical page to several processes, e.g., system data
* Page Table Entry also includes a write protection bit.
  * ﻿﻿If on, then page is "protected":
  * ﻿﻿e.g., program code, system data, etc.
  * ﻿﻿Writing to a protected page triggers an exception. Exceptions are handled by OS. (more later)
