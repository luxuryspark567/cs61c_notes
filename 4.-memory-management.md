# 4. Memory Management

## Endianness

* "little endian", The least significant byte of a value is stored first.
* "big endian", The most significant byte of a value is stored first.

## Word Alignment

* byte-addressable: Hardware's memory composed of 8-bit storage cells
* <mark style="color:red;">word size:</mark> number of bits in an address
  * A 32b architecture has 4-byte words.
  * All pointer sizes on 32b architecture: sizeof(int \*) == ... == sizeof(char \*) == 4
* Unaligned access are not allowed or very slow on different processors.
* sizeof(char) == 1 byte for any architectures.

## Structures&#x20;

* C compilers often align the data with padding.

## C Program Address Space

* **Stack**: local variables inside functions, grows downward
* **Heap**: space requested via malloc(); resizes dynamically, grows upward.
* **Data (Static Data)**: variables decleared outside main, does not grow or shrink.
* **Text (aka code)**: program executable loaded when program starts, does not change.
* 0x00000000 chunck is unwritable/unreadable so that crash on NULL pointer access.

* **Global**: if declared outside a function, allocated in data (static) storage.
* **Local**: if declared inside a function, allocated on the stack and freed when the function returns. NB: main() is also a function.
* For both these memory types, the management is automatic.
  * Don't need to wory about deallocating when no longer use them;
  * But a variable does not exist anymore once a function ends!!

## The Stack

* Every time a function is called, a new <mark style="color:red;">stack frame</mark> is allocated on the stack.
* A stack frame includes:
  * Return "instruction" address (who called me?)
  * Arguments
  * Space for other local variables
* Stack frames contiguous blocks of memory; the <mark style="color:red;">stack pointer</mark> indicates the start of stack frames.
* When function ends, stack frame is tossed off the stack; frees memory for future stack frames.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">It is catastrophically bad to return a pointer to something in the stack</mark>. Memory will be overwritten when other functions are called. So your data would no longer exist, and writes can overwrite key pointers, causing crashes. Used heap instead.
{% endhint %}

## Heap

The heap is <mark style="color:red;">dynamic memory</mark>, memory that can be allocated, resized, and freed during program runtime. Unlike the stack, memory gets resued only when programmer explicitly cleans up.

* **malloc()**:&#x20;
  * `void *malloc(size_t n)`
  * Uninitialized
* calloc():
  * `void *calloc(size_t count, size_t size)`
  * Allocates a block of count \* size bytes, <mark style="color:red;">sets every value in the block to zero.</mark>
* **free()**:&#x20;
  * `void free(void *ptr)`
  * be <mark style="color:red;">sure to pass</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**the original address**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">returned from malloc()</mark>. Otherwise, crash.
* **realloc()**:&#x20;
  * void \*realloc(void \*ptr, size\_t size)
  * Returns new address of the memory block. In doing so, it may need to copy all data to a new location.
  * <mark style="color:red;">realloc(NULL, size)</mark>; behaves like malloc
  * <mark style="color:red;">realloc(ptr, 0)</mark>; behaves like free, deallocates heap block.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Always <mark style="color:red;">check for return NULL</mark>, which would mean you have run out of memory.
{% endhint %}

## Working with Memory

Constants (constant variables or values) can be saved in code, static or stack memory. Constants can be compiled directly into the code. x = x + 1 can compile with the number 1 stored directly in the machine instruction in the code. That instruction will always increment the value of the variable x by 1, so it can be stored directly in the machine instruction without reference to other memory. This can also occur with pre-processor macros:

Machine code is save in code memory.

* Code, Static storage never grow or shrink.
* Stack space is easy:
  * Stack frames are created and destroyed in LIFO order.
  * Avoid "dangling references" : pointers to deallocated variables (e.g., from old stack frames).
* Heap is tricky:
  * Memory can be allocated/deallocated at any time.
  * "Memory leak": <mark style="color:red;">Failure to free() allocated memory</mark>.
  * "Dangling reference" : If use data after calling free, possible crash or exploitable vulnerability.
  * "Double free": if call free() 2x on same memory, possible crash or exploitable vulnerability.



{% hint style="info" %}
In recursive function calls, should store data on stack over heap: recursive call involves frequently memory space allocation and free, and this may cause fragmentation problem in heap.
{% endhint %}

## Implementing Memory Management

Ideas:

* Want malloc() and free() to run quickly;
* Want minimal memory overhead
* Want to avoid fragmentation (when most of our free memory is in many small chunks). In this case, we might have many free bytes but not be able to satisfy a large request synce the free bytes are not contiguous in memory.

### K\&R Malloc/Free Implementation

* Each block of memory is preceded by a header that has two fields:
  * size of the block
  * a pointer to the next block
* All free blocks are kept in a circular linked list.
* In an allocated block, the header's pointer field is unused.

Impementation:

* malloc() searches the free list for a block that is big enough. If none is found, more memory is requested from the OS. If what it gets can't satisfy the request, it fails.
* free() checks if the blocks adjacent to the freed block are also free.&#x20;
  * If so, adjacent free blocks are merged (coalesced) into a single, larger free block.
  * Otherwise, freed block is just added to the free list.

### Choosing a block in malloc()

If there are multiple free blocks of memory that are big enough for some reuqest, how do we choose which one to use:

* best-fit: choose the smallest block that is big enough for the request;
* first-fit: choose the first block we see that is big enough;
* next-fit: like first-fit, but remember where we finished searching and resum searching from there.
