# 7. Intro to RISC-V

* Different CPUs implement different sets of instructions. The set of instructions a particular CPU implements is an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)&#x20;
  * Examples: ARM (cell phones), Intel x86 (i9, i7, i5, i3), IBM/Motorola PowerPC (old Macs), MIPS, RISC-V, ...
* Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) philosophy:&#x20;
  * Keep the instruction set small and simple, makes it easier to build fast hardware&#x20;
  * Let software do complicated operations by composing simpler ones&#x20;
  * This went against the conventional wisdom of the time (he who laughs last, laughs best)

## Conclusion

* In RISC-V Assembly Language:
  * Registers replace C variables
  * One instruction (simple operation) per line
* In RV32, words are 32b
* Instructions:
  * instruction: <mark style="color:yellow;">opname rd, rs1, rs2</mark>
  * immediate: <mark style="color:yellow;">opname rd, rs1, imm</mark>
    * the last operand must be a number, not a register.
* Registers:
  * Each RISC-V register is 32 bits wide
  * 32 registers, referred to as x0 â€“ x31
  * Zero: x0 (hardware zero)
    * add x3, x4, x0 # f = g
    * addi x3, x0, 0xff # f=0xff
    * add x0,x3,x4 (NOP)
