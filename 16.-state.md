## Flip-flop&#x20;

* The output flips and flops between and 0,1
* D is “data”, Q is “output”
* Also called “<mark style="color:yellow;">D-type Flip-Flop</mark>” There used to be other types of flip-flops
* <mark style="color:yellow;">On the</mark> <mark style="color:red;">rising edge</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;">of the clock, the input d is sampled and transferred to the output. At all other times, the input d is ignored.</mark>

## SR Flip-Flop

More detailed explaination: [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/sequential/seq\_1.html](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/sequential/seq_1.html)

It can be seen that when both inputs S = “1” and R = “1” the outputs Q and invert\_Q can be at either logic level “1” or “0”, <mark style="color:yellow;">depending upon the state of the inputs S or R</mark> <mark style="color:red;">**BEFORE**</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;">this input condition existed</mark>. Therefore the condition of S = R = “1” does not change the state of the outputs Q and the inverse of Q.

However, <mark style="color:yellow;">the input state of S = “0” and R = “0” is an undesirable or invalid condition and must be avoided. The condition of S = R = “0” causes both outputs Q and the inverse of Q to be HIGH together at logic level “1” when we would normally want Q to be the inverse of Q</mark>.

The result is that the flip-flop looses control of Q and the inverse of Q, and if the two inputs are now switched “HIGH” again after this condition to logic “1”, the flip-flop becomes unstable and switches to an unknown data state based upon the unbalance as shown in the following switching diagram.

## Gated SR Flip-flop

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (195).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When the Enable input “EN” is at logic level “0”, the outputs of the two AND gates are also at logic level “0”, (AND Gate principles) regardless of the condition of the two inputs S and R, latching the two outputs Q and <mark style="color:yellow;">the inverse of</mark> Q into their last known state.

When the enable input “EN” changes to logic level <mark style="color:yellow;">“1” the circuit responds as a normal SR bistable flip-flop with the two AND gates becoming transparent to the Set and Reset signals.</mark>

This additional enable input can also be connected to a clock timing signal (CLK) adding clock synchronisation to the flip-flop creating what is sometimes called a “<mark style="color:yellow;">Clocked SR Flip-flop</mark>“.

So a **Gated Bistable SR Flip-flop** operates as a standard bistable latch but the outputs are only activated when a logic “1” is applied to its EN input and deactivated by a logic “0”.

## D-type Flip-Flop Circuit

We remember that a simple SR flip-flop requires two inputs, one to “SET” the output and one to “RESET” the output. By connecting an inverter (NOT gate) to the SR flip-flop we can “SET” and “RESET” the flip-flop using just one input as now the two input signals are complements of each other. This complement avoids the ambiguity inherent in the SR latch when both inputs are LOW, since that state is no longer possible.

Thus this single input is called the “DATA” input. If this data input is held HIGH the flip flop would be “SET” and when it is LOW the flip flop would change and become “RESET”. However, this would be rather pointless since the output of the flip flop would always change on every pulse applied to this data input.

To avoid this an additional input called the “CLOCK” or “ENABLE” input is used to isolate the data input from the flip flop’s latching circuitry after the desired data has been stored. <mark style="color:yellow;">The effect is that D input condition is only copied to the output Q when the clock input is active. This then forms the basis of another sequential device called a</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**D Flip Flop**</mark>.

The “D flip flop” will store and output whatever logic level is applied to its data terminal so long as the clock input is HIGH. Once the clock input goes LOW the “set” and “reset” inputs of the flip-flop are both held at logic level “1” so it will not change state and store whatever data was present on its output before the clock transition occurred. In other words the output is “latched” at either logic “0” or logic “1”.

* Also, in practice X might not arrive to the adder at the same time as S\_{i-1}&#x20;
* S\_i temporarily is wrong, but register always captures correct value.&#x20;
* In good circuits, instability never happens around rising edge of clk.
* Shadow area in S\_i: <mark style="color:yellow;">X\_i is changing and not not stable, thus it could be new value and old value at the same time, thus it's a undefined state</mark>.

* Critical Path(CP): The longest delay between two state element
  * CP = clk-to-q(Reg1) + longest CL delay + setup time(Reg2)
* Setup time and combinatorial delay constraint: \
  Clock period >= clk-to-q delay + longest combinatorial delay + setup time
  * After the rising edge, we have to wait clk-to-q delay for the Q output to change
  * Then, we have to wait the longest combinatorial delay for the result to appear at the D input
  * Then, we have to hold that D input stable for the setup time
* Hold time constraint:\
  Hold time <= clk-to-q delay + shortest combinatorial delay
  * After the rising edge, we have to wait clk-to-q delay for the Q output to change
  * Then, after the shortest combinatorial delay, one of the D inputs will change
  * We need the hold time to be over by the time the D input changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Normally, hold time is always small enough.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Hold-time is defined as the time needed after the rising edge, thus the D inputs should remain remain stable for at least hold-time period. That's why (the clk-to-q delay + shortest combinatorial delay) is used to constrain hold-time.</mark>

## Pipeline to improve performance

* Extra Registers are often added to help speed up the clock rate.
* TradeOff: Through put is larger, but the latency for one job is longer.
