# 5. Generics Function Pointers

* Function pointers enable **higher-order functions** in C.&#x20;
  * map, filter, sorting, etc.&#x20;
    * Define: <mark style="color:red;">`int(*fp)(int)`</mark>
    * Call:`(`<mark style="color:red;">`*fp`</mark>`)(...);`
    * Assign:`fp =`` `<mark style="color:red;">`&`</mark>`multiply;`
  * C is designed in such a way that <mark style="color:red;">both function name identifier as well as variable holding function's pointer mean the same</mark>: <mark style="color:red;">address to CODE memory</mark>. And it allows to jump to that memory by using `call()` syntax either on an identifier or variable.
  *   Outside of declaration, <mark style="color:red;">functions implicitly convert to pointers</mark>. function pointers dereference just fine, but the resulting function designator will be immediately converted back to a function pointer.

      ```
      // the same
      test = myprint;
      test = &myprint;
      test = *myprint;
      test = **********myprint;
      ```
* Generic functions (i.e., generics), use void \* pointers to operate on memory.&#x20;
  * Generics are widely present in the C standard library (malloc, memcpy, qsort, …)&#x20;
    * memcpy: memory areas **MUST NOT** overlap
    * `memmove:`Memory areas MIGHT overlap, and slowr for temporary storage, and risks running out of memory.
  * Generics require a solid understanding of memory! By manipulating arbitrary bytes, you risk violating data boundaries, e.g., “Frankenstein”-ing two halves of ints.&#x20;
* Reminders when writing generics:&#x20;
  * Generic pointers do not support dereferencing, as the number of bytes to access from memory is not known at compile-time.&#x20;
  * Instead, use <mark style="color:red;">byte</mark> handling functions (memcpy, memmove).&#x20;
  * Pointer arithmetic: first cast to byte arrays with `(char *)`.
