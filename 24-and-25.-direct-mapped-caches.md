# 24&25. Direct Mapped Caches

In a direct-mapped cache, <mark style="color:yellow;">each memory address is associated with one possible block within the cache</mark>&#x20;

Therefore, we only need to look in a single location in the cache for the data if it exists in the cache&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">Block is the unit of transfer between cache and memory</mark>

## Terminology

All fields are read as unsigned integers.&#x20;

* Index：specifies the cache index (which “row”/block of the cache we should look in) Offset once we’ve found correct block, specifies which byte within the block we want Tag the remaining bits after offset and index are determined; these are used to distinguish between all the memory addresses that map to the same location
