# 3. Points, Arrays and Strings

## Pointer

A variable that contains the address of another variable.

* Pointer Syntax
  * **Declaration**: <mark style="color:red;">\*</mark>;
  * **Address**: <mark style="color:red;">&</mark>;
  * **Dereference**: <mark style="color:red;">\*</mark>;
* Pointers to Different Data Types
  * to primitives: int \*xptr;
  * to struct: struct llist \*foo\_ptr;
  * to function: int (\*fn) (void \*, void \*) = \&foo;
  * general pointers: void \*ptr;
  * null pointer: all 0s;
  * handle, pointer to pointer, to pass into a function to change: \*\*handle;

## Array

*   <mark style="color:red;">An array name is not a variable,</mark> A C array is really just a big block of memory. (<mark style="color:red;">arr is identical to \&arr</mark>)\
    // a locates in 0x10C

    ```
    int a[4];
    printf("a:%x\n", a); // a:10C
    printf("&a:%x\n", &a); // &a:10C
    ```
* <mark style="color:red;">The array size is lost if an array is passed to a function as a pointer, be careful with sizeof()</mark>. Should always explicitly include array length as a parameter.

## Multidimensional Array

```
int **array = malloc(nrows * sizeof(int *));
for(i = 0; i < nrows; i++)
    array[i] = malloc(ncolumns * sizeof(int));
```

## Arrays vs Pointers

* An array variable is a "pointer" to the first (0-th) element.
  * `char *string` and `char string[]` are nearly identical declarations
  * They differ in very subtle ways: incrementing, declaration of filled arrays.
* Accessing Array Elements
  * arr is an array variable, but it looks like a pointer in many respects (though not all).
  * arr\[0] is the same as \*arr;
  * arr\[2] is the same as \*(arr+2);

## Strings

* String is just an array of characters, <mark style="color:red;">followed by a null terminator</mark>.&#x20;
* Null terminator '\0', ASCII number is 0.
*   The standard C library string.h assumes null-terminated strings. <mark style="color:red;">String operations do not include the null terminator</mark>. strlen(str) is 3 below:&#x20;

    ```
    char *str = "abc";
    char str[] = "abc";
    ```
* Declaring:
  * char s\[] = "hello"
    * Saved in stack,&#x20;
    * Is a structure, allows for indexing
    * Can modify (string in stack)
  * char \*p = "hello"
    * "string literals" can only be stored in static memory(Data);
    * Is a variable, initialized with a address;
    * Can index
    * CANNOT BE MODIFIED (string in static, segfaults)
    * Use strcpy() to modify or copy static strings.

## Conclusion

* C pointers and arrays are pretty much the same, except with function calls.
* C knows how to increment pointers.
* C is an efficient language, but with little protection.
  * Array bounds not checked
  * Variables not automatically initialized
* <mark style="color:red;">Use</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**handles**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">(\*\*ptr) to change pointers;</mark>
* The cost of efficiency is more overhead for the programmer.
