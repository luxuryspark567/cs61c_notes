## Single-cycle CPU & pipelined CPU

* Pipelined CPU uses <mark style="color:red;">one clock for all stages</mark>, clock cycle time is limited by the slower statges.
* <mark style="color:red;">Shade is???</mark>

## Throughput

Recaculate PC + 4 to avoid sending both PC and PC + 4 down pipeline.

## Control is also pipelined

* Control signals are derived from the instruction. Like in the one-cycle CPU, contral is usually computed in ID stage
* Control informantion for later stages  is stored in pipeline registers

## Three Types of Pipeline Hazards&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">A hazard is a situation in which a planned instruction cannot execute in the "proper" clock cycle</mark>.&#x20;

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Structural hazard</mark>:
  * Hardware does not support access across multiple instructions in the same cycle.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Data hazard</mark>:&#x20;
  * Instructions have <mark style="color:yellow;">data dependency</mark>.
  * Need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Control hazard</mark>:
  * Flow of execution depends on previous instruction.

## Structural Hazard

* Solution 1 (inefficient):
  * Instructions take turns using the resource.
  * Some instructions stall while the resource is busy.
* Solution 2: Add more hardware! hold all these limes?
  * Can always solve structural hazards by adding more HW.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">In our current CPU, structural hazards are not an issue</mark>.
    * <mark style="color:yellow;">Seperate IMEM and DMEM avoids structure hazard, and RV32I's required seperate IMEM and DMEM works.</mark>&#x20;
      * <mark style="color:yellow;">Different caches, but the actual memory is the same, then cache access memory might still trigger conflicts? But cache fetches is not so time critical?</mark>
      * <mark style="color:yellow;">IMEM and DMEM is refers to cache memory in the current design?</mark>
    * <mark style="color:yellow;">RegFile have seperate ports for rs1, rs2 and rsW, and they work simutaneously.</mark>

## Data Hazards

* Data hazard:&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Instructions have data dependency.</mark>
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write.</mark>
* Three cases to consider:&#x20;
  * Register access&#x20;
  * ALU Result&#x20;
  * Load data hazard

### Register Access

* If the <mark style="color:yellow;">same register is written and read in one cycle</mark>:
  * WB must write value before ID read new value.
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Not structural hazard</mark>, seperate ports allow simultaneous R/W.
* Solution: Regfile HW should <mark style="color:yellow;">write-then-read</mark> in same cycle
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**Exploits high speed**</mark> of RegFile(100ps + 100ps) (If not fast enough, it is not possible to do this)
  * <mark style="color:red;">Indicated by shading in diagram (Here shows the meaning of shades in RegFile WB and ID)</mark>
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Mignt not always be possible to write-then-read in same cycle, e.g.,</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**in high-frequency designs**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">.</mark>

### ALU Result&#x20;

* Problem:
  * Instruction <mark style="color:yellow;">depends on WB's RegFile write</mark> from previous instruction.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (232).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Solution1: <mark style="color:yellow;">Stalling</mark>
  * "Bubble" to <mark style="color:yellow;">effectively nop</mark>:
    * ﻿﻿Affected pipeline stages do nothing during clock cycles.
    * ﻿﻿Stall all stages by preventing PC, IF/ID pipeline register from writing (more in textbook).
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Stalls reduce performance</mark>.
    * Compiler could rearrange code/insert nops to avoid hazards (and therefore stalls), but this requires knowledge of the pipeline structure.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (231).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Solution2: <mark style="color:yellow;">Forwarding</mark>
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Forwarding, aka bypassing, uses the result when it is computed</mark>.
    * ﻿﻿Don't wait for value to be stored into RegFile.
    * ﻿﻿Instead, grab operand from the pipeline stage.
  * Implementation:
    * Make extra connections in the datapath.
    * Also add forwarding control logic.

## Forward Control Logic

### Load data hazard

* The instruction slot after a load is called the load delay slot.
* If this instruction uses the result of load:
  * The hard ware must <mark style="color:yellow;">stall for one cycle</mark> (plus <mark style="color:blue;">forwarding</mark>).
  * This results in performance loss!

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (237).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Solutjon: Code Scheduling

* Idea: Fix this hazard at the code compilation state

## Control Hazard

Control hazards occur when the instruction fetched may not be the one needed.

## Branch Prediction

* Every taken branch in the simple RV32I pipeline costs 3 clock cycles.
* We can improve the CPU performance on average through branch prediction.
  * Early in the pipline, guess which way braches will go
  * Flush pipeline if branch prediction was incorrect.
* Naive Prediction: Don't take branch. The simple RV32I pipeline effectively always "predicts" that braches are not taken.

## Pipelining and ISA Design

* The RISC-V ISA is designed for pipelining:
  * All instruction are 32 bits wide.
    * Easy to fetch and decode, each in one clock cycle.
    * Contrast with CISC: 1- to 15-byte-wide instructions.
  * A small set of standard instruction formats
    * Can decode/read registers in one stage.
  * Load/store addressing conceptually:
    * Calculate address in 3rd stage (with ALU)
    * Access memory in 4th stage
  * Memory operands are all aligned
    * Memory access takes only one cycle.

Further Increasing Processor Performance

*   Increase clock rate.

    * Limited by technology and power dissipation.


*   Increase pipeline depth.

    *   "Overlap" instructions execution through deeper pipeline, e.g., 10 or 15 stages.

        * Less work per stage -> shorter clock cycle/lower power
        * But more potential for all three types of hazards




* Design a "superscalar" processor.
  * Multiple-issue: Start multiple instructions per clock cycle.
  * Dynamic "out-of-order": Reorder instructions dynamically in HW to reduce impact of hazards.

## CPI Measure in Practice

* Measure CPI on various benchmarks:
  * Known benchmark programs from a variety of application domains:
    * Data compression, code compilation, video recording, network simulation, etc.
