# 22. Pipeline2

## Five Stages

## Single-cycle CPU & pipelined CPU

* Pipelined CPU uses one clock for all stages, clock cycle time is limited by the slower statges.
* Shade is&#x20;

## Throughput

Recaculate PC + 4 to avoid sending both PC and PC + 4 down pipeline.

## Control is also pipelined

* Control signals are derived from the instruction. Like in the one-cycle CPU, contral is usually computed in ID stage
* Control informantion for later stages  is stored in pipeline registers

## Three Types of Pipeline Hazards&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">A hazard is a situation in which a planned instruction cannot execute in the "proper" clock cycle</mark>.&#x20;

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Structural hazard</mark>:
  * Hardware does not support access across multiple instructions in the same cycle.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Data hazard</mark>:&#x20;
  * Instructions have <mark style="color:yellow;">data dependency</mark>.
  * Need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Control hazard</mark>:
  * Flow of execution depends on previous instruction.

## Structural Hazard

* Solution 1 (inefficient):
  * Instructions take turns using the resource.
  * Some instructions stall while the resource is busy.
* Solution 2: Add more hardware! hold all these limes?
  * Can always solve structural hazards by adding more HW.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">In our current CPU, structural hazards are not an issue</mark>.
    * <mark style="color:yellow;">Seperate IMEM and DMEM avoids structure hazard, and RV32I's required seperate IMEM and DMEM works.</mark>
    * <mark style="color:yellow;">RegFile have seperate ports for rs1, rs2 and rW.</mark>

## Data Hazards

* Data hazard:&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Instructions have data dependency.</mark>
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write.</mark>
* Occurs when an instruction reads a register before a previous instruction has finished writing to that register.&#x20;
* Three cases to consider:&#x20;
  * 1\. Register access&#x20;
  * 2\. ALU Result&#x20;
  * 3\. Load data hazard (next time)

## Register Access

*   If the same register is written and read in one cycle:

    * WB must write value before ID read new value.
    * Not structural hazard, seperate ports allow simultaneous R/W.


* Solution: Regfile HW should <mark style="color:yellow;">write-then-read</mark> in same cycle
  * Exploits high speed of RegFile(100ps + 100ps)
  * Indicated by shading in diagram
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">Mignt not always be possible to write-then-read in same cycle, e.g., in high-frequency designs.</mark>

## ALU Result&#x20;

* Problem:
  * Instruction depends on WB's RegFile write from previous instruction.
* Solution1: Stalling
  * "Bubble" to effectively nop:
    * ﻿﻿Affected pipeline stages do nothing during clock cycles.
    * ﻿﻿Stall all stages by preventing\
      PC, IF/ID pipeline register from writing (more in textbook).
  * Stalls reduce performance.
    * Compiler could rearrange code/insert nops to avoid hazards (and therefore stalls), but this requires knowledge of the pipeline structure.
* Solution2: Forwarding
  * Forwarding, aka bypassing, uses the result when it is computed.
    * ﻿﻿Don't wait for value to be stored into RegFile.
    * ﻿﻿Instead, grab operand from the pipeline stage.
  * Implementation:
    * Make extra connections in the datapath.
    * Also add forwarding control logic.
